Let's debug the issue! To help you, I'll need more details about your request. Could you provide:
- The exact request you're sending (method, endpoint, headers, body).
- The expected response versus the actual response.
- Any additional error messages in the console or logs.
In the meantime, here are some general debugging steps for 405 Method Not Allowed:
- Check the API route definitions in your C# codeâ€”make sure the HTTP method matches the request:
app.MapPost("/users", (User user) => { /* logic */ });
app.MapGet("/users/{id:int}", (int id) => { /* logic */ });
app.MapDelete("/users/{id:int}", (int id) => { /* logic */ });
- Verify that your request matches the defined routes.
- Ensure proper request headers, especially for POST and PUT methods (Content-Type: application/json).
- Look at logs or debug output to see where the error originates.
Send me more details, and I'll help pinpoint the issue! ðŸš€
